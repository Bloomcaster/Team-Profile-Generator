# Team-Profile-Generator

This back end application uses node app.js to enable the user to create a team roster for work with Intern, Engineer, and Manager as job titles that need to be filled. Each position then has requirements in terms of email, name, id, office number, school that they hail from a/o github username that is required to be filled by the manager. When this information parameters are fufilled them the app generates a html page showing the inputted information.

Unfortunately, I have a bug in my code with the internInput that I am trying to fix so that the user is prompted to input all the information. My hopes are that I will aquire the tools to debug this code and make it work properly so that this can be a useful tool for any office manager to stay organized.
